# Plagiarism Detection

### *Udacity Practice Project: Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program*

## Installation

	This project requires training on Amazon Sagemaker.
	
    Python versions 3.*.
    Python libraries:
        Numpy
		Pandas
		Sklearn
        Matplotlib
		Torch
		Torchvision
		PIL

## Project Motivation

This was my favorite practice project in my second Udacity Nanodegree Program, the objective was to engineer and select features for plagiarism detection. Some of the framework was already implemented, so we could focus on the feature selection, and setting up Amazon Sagemaker to train our custom defined pytorch model.
